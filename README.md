# ixis-data-analysis
Technical Exercises for the IXIS Data Analyst position:

This project was completed twice: first in python, and then in R. I am much more experienced working with python, so I did the initial data exploration (including creating all of the graphs for the slide deck) in a python notebook.

Next I took the code from that notebook, and tweaked it to make a python script that could more efficiently generate the excel worksheets that were requested in the brief.

Finally, re-wrote the script in R (using tidyverse and openxlsx). Note that apart from some minor formatting differences, the two excel documents are identical, and could be used interchangeably.
